# MyStore E-Commerce Project

## Overview

This is a simple React-based e-commerce website for showcasing products, simulating product browsing, search, and cart functionalities. The app fetches data from the **FakeStore API** to display products, handle user searches, and allow interaction with a product modal for detailed views.

## Features

- **Product Search**: Search for products by category (e.g., Electronics, Jewelry).
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Product Cards**: Display product cards with images, prices, and ratings.
- **Product Modal**: Click on any product card to view more details in a modal window.
- **Cart Counter**: Add products to the cart (local state-based cart functionality).
- **Show More/Show Less**: Control the number of products displayed at once with a "Show More" button.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- npm (or yarn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iTusharyadav/mystore-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mystore-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the app on `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Technologies Used

- **ReactJS** for building the front-end.
- **TailwindCSS** for styling and responsive design.
- **React Hooks** for state management (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- **FakeStore API** for fetching product data.

## Design Considerations

- Followed a clean and minimalistic design to keep the user interface user-friendly.
- Ensured responsiveness across different devices using TailwindCSS utility classes.
- Implemented smooth transitions and animations for interactions such as hovering over product cards and modal opening.

## Areas of Improvement (Optional)

- Implemented only basic cart functionality. If given more time, I would implement a full cart page and checkout flow.
- I would improve error handling for API calls and edge cases such as empty or invalid search results.

## Conclusion

This is a basic e-commerce app that showcases product browsing, modal details, and cart-like functionality. It is responsive and optimized for a seamless user experience across devices.
